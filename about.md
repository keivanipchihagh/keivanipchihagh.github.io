I'm a Machine Learning Engineer during the days ðŸŒž, and a Software Engineer at nights ðŸŒ’. I also do freelancing at times and am learning to trade in Cryptocurrencies.

I've completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en) and planning to do an MBA for my Masters.
